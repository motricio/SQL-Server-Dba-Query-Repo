solution: To solve the problem, UAC filtering for local accounts must be disabled by creating the following 
DWORD registry entry and setting its value to 1:

[HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System] LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy

reason: "In a workgroup, the account connecting to the remote computer is a local user on that computer.
Even if the account is in the Administrators group, UAC filtering means that a script runs as a standard user"
